# Cryptocurrency and Stocks Dashboard


## Introduction Statement

This dashboard designed to offer real-time insights into both cryptocurrency and stock market performance.

In today's fast-paced financial markets, investors and traders face the challenge of monitoring both traditional stocks and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market simultaneously. The vast amount of data, frequent price fluctuations, and the need for real-time information across these two distinct but increasingly interrelated asset classes create a complex environment for decision-making.

At present, users often need to switch between multiple platforms or applications to obtain a comprehensive view of their diverse portfolio, leading to inefficiencies and potential missed opportunities. There exists a clear need for a unified, user-friendly dashboard that consolidates real-time data from both stock and crypto markets, allowing users to:

• Swiftly assess the performance of their entire portfolio.

• Identify trends and correlations between traditional and crypto markets.

• Make informed decisions based on up-to-date, comprehensive market data.

• Customise their view to focus on assets of particular interest.

The proposed Power BI dashboard aims to address these challenges by providing a single, intuitive interface for monitoring and analysing both stock and cryptocurrency markets, empowering users with the information they require to navigate these complex financial landscapes effectively.

# Insights

A 2 page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

• Current Cryptocurrency/Stock Price and Performance: It indicates how a particular cryptocurrency/stock (GOOGL, in this case) is performing, with price changes and percentage movements, helping assess whether the cryptocurrency/stock is gaining or losing value.

• Historical Trends: The candlestick chart gives a visual representation of the cryptocurrency/stock's price movement over time, allowing users to observe trends, such as rising or falling cryptocurrency/stock prices, over different time periods (days, months, or years).

• Comparison Across Stocks: By including a list of other companies' stocks, users can quickly switch and compare how different cryptocurrencies/stocks are performing within the same dashboard.

• Market Sentiment: The general rise or fall of a cryptocurrency/stock price can reflect market sentiment towards a company or sector, giving insight into potential market conditions or investor confidence.

• Dark mode interface for reduced eye strain during extended use.

• This dashboard provides an easy way to monitor cryptocurrency/stock performance and observe general trends, without delving too deeply into specific financial details.
